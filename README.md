# TriviaTownesServer

## Setup
- Open Eclipse
- Go to Project -> Open Projects From File System
- Click directory and select the TriviaTownesServer directory
- (This does not need to be in your current workspace)
- Note: Eclipse will not copy the project, it will just modify it in another directory.
- Click finish
- Set up a Tomcat 9 server if you haven't already in the workspace
- Run the server and navigate to /example in the browser
- If all goes well "testing" will show up on the window
- Let me know if you have any issues getting the server to run

## Gitingore
I created a .gitignore file that should allow us to all work on
different Operating systems (Windows, Linux, Mac) without breaking each others environments. If you pull code down and everything breaks, this is probably because you pulled down files from someone else's environment. If this happens it's my fault (Joe) and we can fix it together. But I'm fairly confident this will not be an issue.
